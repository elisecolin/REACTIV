# REACTIV
## Rapid and EAsy Change detection in radar TIme-series by Variation coefficient

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elisekoeniguer/REACTIV/master/REACTIV.png)


This code was developed at Onera as part of the **MEDUSA** project in 2018

It is intended to display a stack of SAR images with change detection highlighting.

RACTIV exists in 3 languages:
* MATLAB
* PYTHON 3
* JAVASCRIPT for the Google Earth Engine platform
* EOBROWSER: https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-1/reactiv/

:exclamation: Please if you use this code in your research projects, please quote the following paper:

**Colin, E., & Nicolas, J. M. (2020). Change detection based on the coefficient of variation in SAR time-series of urban areas. Remote Sensing, 12(13), 2089.**
