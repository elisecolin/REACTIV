# REACTIV
## Rapid and EAsy Change detection in radar TIme-series by Variation coefficient

### Project Overview
REACTIV was developed at **Onera** as part of the MEDUSA project in 2018. It is designed to visualize stacks of SAR images with change detection highlighting. 
At the **End of 2024**: Major updates developed as part of the **MUSIC** chaire include:
  - A **polarimetric version** for multivariate variation coefficient analysis, implemented in both **Python** and **JavaScript**.
  - A **seasonal version**, as well as **FrozenBackGround** and **NewEvent**, available exclusively on **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.
    
REACTIV exists in multiple programming languages:
- **MATLAB** ((no longer maintained)
- **Python 3** (for standalone and scientific analysis)
- **JavaScript GEE** (for the Google Earth Engine GEE platform)
- **EOBROWSER**: [Sentinel-1 REACTIV script](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-1/reactiv/)


## Installation
For GEE: clone the Git repository by running the following command in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://earthengine.googlesource.com/users/elisecolinaa/REACTIV
```
For Python: a Python notebook is available

## VERSIONS
The repository contains multiple versions of the REACTIV algorithm:

### 1. CLASSIC
**Description:**
The classic version of REACTIV, based on the coefficient of variation for change detection in SAR time-series of urban areas.

### 2. FrozenBackGround *(GEE only)*
**Description:**
Reimplementation of the method for detecting ephemeral objects in SAR time-series using frozen background-based change detection.

---
### 3. NewEvent *(GEE only)*
**Description:**
This version detects changes occurring after a given time-series. Useful for monitoring the appearance of new events following a reference period.

---
### 4. POLARIMETRY *(Python & GEE)*
**Description:**
Implementation of change detection based on the bounds of multivariate coefficients of variation, calculated in their literal formulation.

**Reference:**

---
### 5. Seasons *(GEE only)*
**Description:**
A version that computes time-series by restricting them to a given season.
- Useful for the cryosphere to exclude snowfall periods and changes in the snow cover.
- Relevant for vegetation to eliminate seasonal changes that could distort the detection of anthropogenic or environmental changes.
