# REACTIV
## Rapid and EAsy Change detection in radar TIme-series by Variation coefficient

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elisekoeniguer/REACTIV/master/REACTIV.png)


This code was developed at Onera as part of the **MEDUSA** project in 2018

It is intended to display a stack of SAR images with change detection highlighting.

It is available in 3 languages:
* MATLAB
* PYTHON 3
* JAVASCRIPT for the Google Earth Engine platform
