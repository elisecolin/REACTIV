# REACTIV: Change Detection in SAR Time-Series

## Introduction
REACTIV is a collection of change detection algorithms applied to SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) time-series images. This project includes several implementations based on different scientific approaches to detect changes in various environments, such as urban areas, the cryosphere, and vegetation surfaces.

## Installation
Clone the Git repository by running the following command in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://earthengine.googlesource.com/users/elisecolinaa/REACTIV
```

## Repository Contents
The repository contains five main files, each corresponding to a specific implementation of the REACTIV algorithm:

### 1. CLASSIC
**Description:**
The classic version of REACTIV, based on the coefficient of variation for change detection in SAR time-series of urban areas.

### 2. FrozenBackGround
**Description:**
Reimplementation of the method for detecting ephemeral objects in SAR time-series using frozen background-based change detection.

### 3. NewEvent
**Description:**
This version detects changes occurring after a given time-series. Useful for monitoring the appearance of new events following a reference period.

---
### 4. POLARIMETRY
**Description:**
Implementation of change detection based on the bounds of multivariate coefficients of variation, calculated in their literal formulation.

### 5. Seasons
**Description:**
A version that computes time-series by restricting them to a given season.
- Useful for the cryosphere to exclude snowfall periods and changes in the snow cover.
- Relevant for vegetation to eliminate seasonal changes that could distort the detection of anthropogenic or environmental changes.
